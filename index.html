                <p>Please read over the questions below before submitting your application.

                <h2>Why is the program unique?</h2>

                <p>Entrepreneurs get to work directly with the City and County of San Francisco to develop solutions for
                    pain points and needs of the government, the largest consumer of products and services in the
                    nation. In addition, products and services that successfully solve issues faced by San Francisco can
                    easily expand to addressing similar needs of other cities and states across the nation in addition
                    to the private sector. This is one of the first programs of its kind run by the City itself. This
                    program is not meant to be a traditional accelerator or incubator, but to help formalize the process
                    for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs to navigate the complexity of the public sector.</p>

                <h2>Who is the target entrepreneur?</h2>

                <p>We are looking particularly for entrepreneurial teams who recognize that challenge and opportunity go
                    hand-in-hand. It is also critical that the EIRs think about solving problems at a large scale. Pain
                    points and issues faced by government need technology enabled products and services that can scale
                    well and can function across multiple environments and across different types of users. And we want
                    EIRs who think big! As an analogy, we’re looking for teams who instead of building an app that tells
                    you when the train is delayed, build a product that helps the trains run on time.
                </p>

                <h2>What is the the opportunity in San Francisco?</h2>

                <p>The City and County of San Francisco has an annual budget over $8 billion. It has more than 28,000
                    employees across more than 50 departments and agencies. As the innovation capital of the world, we
                    offer a well-recognized platform to expand to other public sector buyers across the nation. For an
                    interactive view of the city budget and related revenues and expenditures, <a
                            href="http://openbook.sfgov.org/">visit
                        SFOpenBook</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Does my team have to spend 16 weeks "embedded" in San Francisco government offices?</h2>

                <p>While you do not have to be physically in City offices every day, we need companies and teams that
                    are in the Bay Area or are willing to have at least some of the team here over the course of 16
                    weeks. The program is set up to provide a four month runway for you to work with government on
                    developing a product or service that meets the needs of a department or agency and can be applied
                    more broadly. To that end, we work with you to establish a reasonable roadmap over that timeframe.
                    This will vary by team. The best use of that time depends on your team's stage and needs. We want
                    you to be successful and understand that if you're building a business, you'll have to be doing
                    other things as well.
                </p>

                <h2>Is this a full-time or part-time commitment?</h2>

                <p>You have to be a full-time entrepreneur. However, your time commitment to the program is flexible
                    depending on your needs and stage. We recognize that building a business requires having many
                    demands on your time and we appreciate that. We will offer you a variety of resources and insights
                    and it is up to you how much you’d like to benefit from them.</p>

                <h2>What do you mean when you say the product or service has to be self-sustaining?</h2>

                <p>We want you to develop a successful product or service that is valuable to government here in San
                    Francisco and across other cities, states and at the federal level. We expect you to ramp up your
                    business through competitive and compelling offerings that governments consider purchasing because
                    it has a measurable impact such as increased revenue, lower costs or enhanced productivity. </p>

                <h2>How does the EIR program relate to other civic programs like Code for America's Civic
                    Accelerator?</h2>

                <p>The SF EIR program is part of a growing ecosystem of civic innovation. Inspired by <a
                        href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/accelerator/">Code for America’s Civic Accelerator</a>, and
                    joined by <a href="http://www.pointsoflight.org/civic-incubator/civic-accelerator">Points of
                        Light</a> and <a href="http://tumml.org/">Tumml</a> among others, the EIR program seeks to offer
                    another pathway to addressing civic challenges. This is not an accelerator or incubator program, but
                    rather a method for the City and County of San Francisco to formally match entrepreneurs working on
                    products that serve or could serve government to various city agencies and departments. It is our
                    belief that creating a formal pathway can help these entrepreneurs more easily navigate the
                    complexity of working in the public sector and bring better fit solutions to the challenges of
                    government. We applaud CfA's pioneering work in this space and hope our program spurs more
                    entrepreneurs to work on civic problems.</p>
